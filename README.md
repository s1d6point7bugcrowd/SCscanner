# SCscanner

**Version 1.3**

This project is an **automated source code vulnerability scanner** designed for **bug bounty research** and **security analysis**. It scans JavaScript/TypeScript code for security vulnerabilities using multiple static analysis techniques, including **regex-based scanning, Semgrep integration, AST-based analysis, and taint analysis**. It leverages **asynchronous processing with concurrency controls** for high-performance scanning and includes **iterative AST traversal** for efficiency on large codebases.

---

## üöÄ Features

### üîç Multi-Technique Scanning:

- **Regex-Based Scanning:** Quickly identifies potentially dangerous patterns using **regular expressions**.
- **Semgrep Integration:** Runs **Semgrep** to perform rule-based static analysis.
- **AST-Based Analysis:** Uses Node.js with **Esprima** to parse code into an AST and checks for:
  - Cross-Site Scripting (**XSS**)
  - Insecure deserialization
  - Prototype pollution
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (**SSRF**)
  - Regular Expression Denial of Service (**ReDoS**)
  - Open Redirect
  - Command Injection
  - Path Traversal

- **Taint Analysis:** Tracks the flow of **potentially tainted data** through:
  - Assignments & Variable Declarations
  - Function Calls & Arguments
  - Member Expressions & Object Properties
  - Arrays & Template Literals
  - Binary Expressions & User Input Sources

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations:

- **Iterative AST Traversal:** Avoids deep recursion to improve performance on large files.
- **Concurrency:** Async processing with `asyncio` and `aiolimiter` enables **efficient parallel scanning**.
- **Configurable Maximum Concurrency:** Limits the number of concurrent analyses for optimized performance.

### üõ†Ô∏è Configurable Analysis:

- **Dangerous Patterns from JSON File:** Easily update patterns in `dangerous_patterns.json`.
- **Custom Semgrep Rules:** Uses **Semgrep** for additional vulnerability detection.
- **Optional Syntax Highlighting:** Uses **Pygments** (if installed) to enhance output readability.

### üìã Comprehensive Reporting:

- **Findings Grouped by Type:** Regex-based, Semgrep, Contextual (AST), and Taint Analysis.
- **Detailed Output:** Includes file name, line number, affected code snippet, and vulnerability details.
- **Severity Levels:** Each finding is assigned a severity level (**Critical, High, Medium, Low**).
- **Contextual Code Snippets:** Displays **surrounding lines** to help understand findings.
- **Support for Multiple Output Formats (Planned):** Future support for **JSON, SARIF, and HTML reporting**.

üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability Detection Details
Regex-Based Scanning

    Uses regex patterns stored in dangerous_patterns.json to detect known insecure patterns.

AST-Based Analysis

    Uses Esprima to parse JavaScript/TypeScript into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
    Detects vulnerabilities such as:
        eval(), Function(), setTimeout(), setInterval() misuse.
        child_process.exec, child_process.spawn (Command Injection).
        document.write(), innerHTML (XSS vulnerabilities).
        Prototype pollution (__proto__, Object.prototype modification).
        Insecure use of require(), import().
        fetch(), XMLHttpRequest (Potential SSRF).

Taint Analysis

    Tracks the flow of tainted data (potential user input) reaching dangerous sinks.
    Identifies data from taint sources:
        process.argv
        process.env
        fs.readFileSync()
        User-controlled require() imports.
    Flags potentially dangerous operations:
        Tainted data passed to eval(), Function(), child_process.exec(), etc.
        Tainted data in SQL queries (mysql.query()).
        Tainted user input reflected in HTML (innerHTML, document.write()).

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Modify the CONFIG dictionary in scanner.py to customize:

CONFIG = {
    "NPM_REGISTRY_URL": "https://registry.npmjs.org/",
    "HEADERS": {
        'User-Agent': 'AutomatedSourceReviewScript/1.3',
        'X-Custom-Header': 's1d6p01nt7@bugcrowdninja.com'

    "DANGEROUS_PATTERNS_FILE": "dangerous_patterns.json",
    "SEMGREP_CONFIG": "auto",
    "MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS": 10

üìÑ Example Output

[High] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) detected!
  File: src/components/button.js
  Line: 42
  Code: element.innerHTML = userInput; // Potentially unsafe
  Issue: User-controlled input assigned to innerHTML (Severity: High)

[Critical] Command Injection
  File: server.js
  Line: 23
  Code: exec(`rm -rf ${userInput}`); // User input in exec()
  Issue: User-controlled input passed to child_process.exec() (Severity: Critical)


üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

    Interprocedural Analysis: Analyze how data flows between different files/modules.
    Control Flow Graph (CFG) Analysis: Improve vulnerability detection for logic-based security flaws.
    Data Flow Analysis: More robust tracking of tainted data across multiple sources/sinks.
    SARIF/JSON/HTML Reporting: Export results in machine-readable formats for integration into security tools.
